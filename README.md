# Slay-the-Spire-Randomizer
In order to generate truly random runs in a Slay the Spire, I have made a custom randomizer.

In one of my all time favorite video games Slay the Spire, there is a random run feature. This feature doesn't acutally give you random changes, because several features are not inlcuded in the pool of options, and some are mutually exclusive. I have made a true randomizer that can give you any combination, and it allows you to input how many positive, negative, or neutral changes to be made. So that if you want a hard run you can get only hard traits.
